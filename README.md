# OOP Lab Work

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab Work repository! This repository contains various lab exercises and examples demonstrating the principles and practices of OOP in C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders and files, each focusing on specific aspects of OOP. Below is an overview of the structure:

``` bash
OOP_Lab/
├── DogExample/
│   ├── DogExample.cpp
│   └── README.md
└── PersonExample/
    ├── PersonExample.cpp
    └── README.md
```

## Examples

### Dog Example

This example models a `Dog` class with properties such as `name`, `age`, and `breed`. It includes unique methods for barking and fetching. The example demonstrates how to create multiple instances of the `Dog` class and invoke their methods.

- **File:** `DogExample/DogExample.cpp`
- **Key Concepts:** Class definition, constructors, private properties, public methods, and object instantiation.

### Person Example

This example models a `Person` class with properties like `age`, `height`, and `name`. It demonstrates how to use a constructor to initialize these properties and how to display the person's details.

- **File:** `PersonExample/PersonExample.cpp`
- **Key Concepts:** Class definition, constructors, private properties, public methods, and object instantiation.

## How to Run the Code

To compile and run the examples, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KigoJomo/OOP_Lab.git
   cd OOP_Lab
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired example directory:**

   ```bash
   cd DogExample
   ```

3. **Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler:**

   ```bash
   g++ DogExample.cpp -o DogExample
   ```

4. **Run the executable:**

   ```bash
   ./DogExample
   ```

Repeat the steps for other examples by navigating to their respective directories and compiling the code.
